      <p>But the past 12 months haven’t been kind to the Giants. They slumped in the second half of last year, held on to make the playoffs as a wild card team and have been planted firmly in last place in the NL West most of this season while setting a franchise record with 56 losses before the All-Star break. The chart shows how far they’ve fallen from their perch atop the league last year.</p>

      <p>The Giants played 162 games -- the equivalent of a full regular season -- from last year’s All-Star break to this year’s break. In those games, they went 64-98 and were the second-worst team in the entire league.</p>

      <p>A look inside the numbers shows the fall is no fluke. The following charts break down team stats based on the first half of last year, the second half of last year and the first half of this year. In almost all cases, the decline has been steady and steep.</p>

    <div class="chart" id="chart0">
      <div class="chart-title">Winning percentage</div>
      <div class="chart-deck">From 102-win pace at the break last year to losing nearly 100 games in the span of a season.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="chart" id="chart1">
      <div class="chart-title">Runs per game</div>
      <div class="chart-deck">If it seems like the offense has gotten worse, it’s because it has -- by nearly a full run per game.</div>

      <div class="chart-title">Batting average</div>
      <div class="chart-deck">Imagine if Buster Posey was slumping like the rest of the team.</div>

    <div class="chart" id="chart3">
      <div class="chart-title">Home runs per game</div>
      <div class="chart-deck">Yes, the Giants are last in the league in homers, but they weren’t any better in the first half last year when they were winning.</div>

    <div class="chart" id="chart4">
      <div class="chart-title">OPS</div>
      <div class="chart-deck">Like the runs per game, this is another stat that illustrates the offense’s dramatic decline.</div>

      <div class="chart-title">Team ERA</div>
      <div class="chart-deck">Starting pitching is supposed to be the strength of the team. But when the starting five have an ERA hovering around 5.00 and the offense scores less than four runs per game, it’s no wonder they’re at the bottom of the standings.</div>
